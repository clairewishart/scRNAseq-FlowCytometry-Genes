# scRNAseq-FlowCytometry-Genes
Code for identifying cell type-defining genes from scRNA-seq data, optimized for translation to flow cytometry. Includes data pre-processing, dimensional reduction, clustering, and random forest classifiers to characterize immune cell subsets in an EAE model, aiming to simplify immune cell identification using a minimal gene set
